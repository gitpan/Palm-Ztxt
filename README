Palm/Ztxt version .38
=========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

For right now Modify Makefile.PL and adjust the libs line to point to
your zxtext libarary lib and include paths.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


Ignore the following: TBD. :)
if Makefile.PL is unable to determine the location of libztxt and its include
files, you will be prompted for the names.  If you already know that
Makefile.PL will not be able to find your libararies, or if you want to use
a different set of libraries, you can specifiy the include and library 
paths on the command line using "--libs='-L/path/to/libs -llibrary'" 
and "--include='-I/path/to/includes'"

For information on how to install this library in a non-standard location
(your ISP does not give you admin rights, or your admin is the BOFH,
for example), refer to the MakeMaker documentation, 
'perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker'.


DEPENDENCIES

For the test to be run Test::More must be installed but is not required for 
the reguar use of this module.

The ztxt libraries that come as part of the Weasel book reader are required to
build this module. If you do not already have the ztext libararies they are 
distrubted with makeztext which you can find the Weasel Reader sourceforge 
project download page:
'http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9595'.

libz is also required, but this comes will all modern operating systems, so if
if you are using anything remotely modern you will already have this installed
(Unless, that is you rolled your own distro and somehow got by without 
installing it).
